# About this Project
Hello everyone! This is a small repo with some beginner projects made in Python, used for educative purposes. Feel free to use them however you want. They are each explained and commented on their own files. The goal is to have around ten projects, with various difficulties and complexities, made with the objective to learn Python effectively.
